Paper: A binary classification framework for two stage multiple kernel learning, ICML 2011

Usage:
[w1 w2] = binarymkl (M, tr_label, pathfile, resultfile, EXPname, permind);
 (read the comments in file binarymkl.m for description of input and output parameters)

Contents:
- Two pegasos based implementations (modified from original pegasos to add additional projection onto positive orthant)
  -- pegasos: do "make" to build the executable on your platform
  -- pegasosMultLambda: do "make" to build the executable on your platform
- paths.m: example pathfile
- other .m files needed for running "binarymmkl.m"
